# Celestial Navigator for X-Plane

The aim of this project is to wholeheartedly bring celestial navigation into x-plane.
It aims to do this a number of ways:

1. provide an automatic connection between [x-plane](http://www.x-plane.com/desktop/home/) and [Stellarium](http://www.stellarium.org/)
   + provide plugin for Stellarium to do this
   + provide plugin for x-plane to do this
2. provide a sextant like tool as a plugin for Stellarium
3. provide an automated navigator for x-plane, who can take sights, dead reckon, and is affected by the weather conditions.
   Idea is very much based on the [fantastic real navigation mod](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ8pHSRxCl8) for Silent Hunter 5
4. provide weather effects for stellarium
5. provide a java libgdx application with:
   + map plotting tools
   + navaids from x-plane database
   + an easily accesible almanac
   + automatic connection with Stellarium's sextant plugin

The basis for network communication with stellarium is a protocol buffer, and udp sockets. 
This should allow other simulators such as fsx, p3d, silent hunter or any other game
or simulator to easily implement their own input into stellarium.

## Project Status

### Done:
+ Basic Plugin for x-plane

+ Communication is working, and x-plane can successfully update Stellarium position and times

### Partial:
+ Libgdx application, have basic map working

### Todo:
+ automatic periodic position/time updates
+ Configuration files for x-plane
+ Configuration files for stellarium
+ Configuration ui for stellarium
+ make dynamic version of plugin and provide windows and mac builds
+ Sextant plugin for stellarium
+ automated navigator for x-plane
+ weather effects for stellarium
+ java application

## Credits
+ Heavily based on Joan Perez's Ground Services plugin.
